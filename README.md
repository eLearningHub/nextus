# Installation and Development

## Directus - Headless CMS

### 1 Setup Directus

Use [Directus Cloud](https://directus.cloud/register)/[Self-Hosting](https://docs.directus.io/self-hosted/quickstart.html) to quickly set up your own instance of directus.

Then, apply the [Schema Snapshot](https://github.com/luochuanyuewu/nextus-docker/blob/main/snapshots/schema.yml) provided by Nextus using the [Schema Migration](https://docs.directus.io/guides/migration/hoppscotch.html) feature.

Or, using [Nextus-Docker](https://github.com/luochuanyuewu/nextus-docker) to quickly setup Nextus backend with automaic schema applying.

This way, your Nextus backend will be fully prepared.

### 2 Setup required Content/Environment

After setting up the Directus instance, you need to prepare the following necessary content for the frontend to function properly.

Content-related:

- Add the languages you need to the Languages model (Though you can add as many as you want, but currently only 'en' and 'zh' supported.)
- Add a page with the slug "home",
- Add a top navigation with the slug "main" and a footer navigation with the slug "footer"
- Add other required data in "global" seciton.

![Language setup](docs/language_setup.png)
![Navigation setup](docs/navigation_setup.png)

Environment variables:

- Refer to .env.example

---

## Nextus - Frontend(前端)

Nextus is built using Next.js 13 on the front-end. All you need to do is fork a copy to your own Github account, connect it with Vercel, set up a few environment variables (for connecting with Directus), and your Nextus will be live.

Of course, you can also clone the repository locally and customize it according to your own needs.

## Enjoy!

Now, you have a Nextus backend (built with Directus) and a Nextus frontend (built with Nextjs).

Start adding your own content in Nextus and experience the charm of headless CMS and modern frontend websites!

# Statement

Originally, I encountered Strapi before I discovered Directus, so I built my personal website with it (this repository). After encountering Directus and trying it for a week, I immediately switched from Strapi to Directus, and my personal website also started to transition towards the AgencyOS template. This is why you can still see some Strapi-related components in the repository (marked as _Deprecated), but please don't worry, these files will also be adopted into Directus, so that Nextus will have more Blocks to use.
